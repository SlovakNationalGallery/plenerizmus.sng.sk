plenerizmus.sng.sk is a Laravel based web app that complements the exhibition [From the Academy to Nature](https://www.sng.sk/en/exhibitions/2051_from-the-academy-to-nature-forms-of-landscape-painting-in-central-europe-1860-1890)
 in the Slovak National Gallery.

Mood, motive and weather search draws attention to the phenomena that the artists had been noticing when working in nature. Their efforts to capture an ephemeral impression, more relaxed style and braver use of colour facilitated the transformation of the landscape painting towards impressionism and modern art. The fascination by nature and the talent of observing are documented through authentic quotes from the diaries of the authors displayed at the exhibition.
